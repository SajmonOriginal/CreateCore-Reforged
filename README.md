## About Create mod

The unique Create modification offers a variety of tools and blocks for building, decorating, and aesthetic automation. The added technical elements are designed to leave the player with as many design choices as possible. With the Create mod, the game doesn't take place inside a pile of user interfaces, but challenges you to build inventions from animated components that work together in many possible arrangements.

Recently, a new update to Create mod 0.5 called FULL STEAM has just been released, where you can make trains!

ðŸš‚ The implementation of trains in Create 0.5 is simply amazing.
Perfectly this new thing fits the aesthetics of the game. Almost everything is built out of plain vanilla blocks and fits into the world like it was meant to be there from the start, and you can see that someone really took the time to think this through.

ðŸš† There's a LOT to do. Roundabouts, T-junctions, Y-junctions, intersections, tunnels, bridges, you name it, all controlled by simple signals. Wow. Add to that the ability to actually move things, and we're in the good old world of traffic tycoons.

## Build

Clone this repository and run the commands below:

**Windows:**

```bat
packwiz modrinth export
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```sh
./packwiz modrinth export
```
